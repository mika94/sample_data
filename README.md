# sample_data

Here are some CSVs that I created for a project in a data sciences course. It includes a list of Canadian universities, names of data sciences courses in Canada, 
and randomly generated names and addresses for people in Canada. There is also a CSV including the distance between a subset of the people and universities (in km). 

Here are the fields available in the CSVs:
